# JavaFX-example-BMI-Calculator
This is a simple JavaFX GUI application
The user types in his/her height and weight in metrics, and the program checks for their validities and thereafter calculates BMI based on those inputs. Then it also tells if that person is healthy, underweight, or obese based on some conventional standard.
